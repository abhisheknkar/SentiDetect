            <paragraph>With the increasing use of research paper search engines, such as CiteSeer, for both literature search and hiring decisions, the accuracy of such systems is of paramount importance. This paper employs Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) for the task of extracting various common fields from the headers and citation of research papers. The basic theory of CRFs is becoming well-understood, but best-practices for applying them to real-world data requires additional exploration. This paper makes an empirical exploration of several factors, including variations on Gaussian, exponential and hyperbolic-Li priors for improved regularization, and several classes of features and Markov order. On a standard benchmark data set, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance, reducing error in average F1 by 36%, and word error rate by 78% in comparison with the previous best SVM results. Accuracy compares even more favorably against HMMs.</paragraph>

                Research paper search engines, such as CiteSeer (<cite id="1" function="ack" polarity="neu">Lawrence et al., 1999</cite>) and Cora (<cite id="2" function="ack" polarity="neu">McCallum et al., 2000</cite>), give researchers tremendous power and convenience in their research.

            They are also becoming increasingly used for recruiting and hiring decisions. Thus the information quality of such systems is of significant importance. This quality critically depends on an information extraction component that extracts meta-data, such as title, author, institution, etc, from paper headers and references, because these meta-data are further used in many component applications such as field-based search, author analysis, and citation analysis.</paragraph>

                Previous work in information extraction from research papers has been based on two major machine learning techniques. The first is hidden Markov models (HMM) (<cite id="3" function="ack" polarity="neu">Seymore et al., 1999</cite>; <cite id="4" function="ack" polarity="neu">Takasu, 2003</cite>).
                </context>

            An HMM learns a generative model over input sequence and labeled sequence pairs. While enjoying wide historical success, standard HMM models have difficulty modeling multiple non-independent features of the observation sequence.

            <paragraph>
                <context>
                Conditional random fields (CRFs) are undirected graphical models trained to maximize a conditional probability (<cite id="14" function="ack" polarity="neu">Lafferty et al., 2001</cite>).
                </context>
            A common special-case graph structure is a linear chain, which corresponds to a finite state machine, and is suitable for sequence labeling. A linear-chain CRF with parameters A = (A,...} defines a conditional probability for a state (or label) sequence y = y1...yT given an input sequence x = x1...xT to be where Zx is the normalization constant that makes the probability of all state sequences sum to one, fk (yt-1 , yt, x, t) is a feature function which is often binary-valued, but can be real-valued, and Ak is a learned weight associated with feature fk. The feature functions can measure any aspect of a state transition, yt-1 — yt, and the observation sequence, x, centered at the current time step, t. For example, one feature function might have value 1 when yt-1 is the state Title, yt is the state Author, and xt is a word appearing in a lexicon of people's first names. Large positive values for Ak indicate a preference for such an event, while large negative values make the event unlikely.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Given such a model as defined in Equ. (1), the most probable labeling sequence for an input x, arg max PA(yjx), y can be efficiently calculated by dynamic programming using the Viterbi algorithm. Calculating the marginal probability of states or transitions at each position in the sequence by a dynamic-programming-based inference procedure very similar to forward-backward for hidden Markov models.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The parameters may be estimated by maximum likelihood—maximizing the conditional probability of a set of label sequences, each given their corresponding input sequences. The log-likelihood of training set</paragraph>
            <paragraph>We consider here only finite state models in which there is a one-to-one correspondence between states and labels; this is not, however, strictly necessary. Figure 1 : Empirical distribution of A</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Maximizing (2) corresponds to satisfying the following equality, whereinthe the empirical count ofeach feature matches its expected count according to the model PA(yjx).</paragraph>
            <paragraph>CRFs share many of the advantageous properties of standard maximum entropy models, including their convex likelihood function, which guarantees that the learning procedure converges to the global maximum.

            We use BFGS for optimization. In our experiments, we shall focus instead on two other aspects of CRF deployment, namely regulariza-tion and selection of different model structure and feature types.</paragraph>

                <subtitle>2.1 Regularization in CRFs</subtitle>
                <paragraph>To avoid over-fitting, log-likelihood is often penalized by some prior distribution over the parameters. Figure 1 shows an empirical distribution of parameters, A, learned from an unpenalized likelihood, including only features with non-zero count in the training set. Three prior distributions that have shape similar to this empirical distribution are the Gaussian prior, exponential prior, and hyperbolic-L1 prior, each shown in Figure 2. In this paper we provide an empirical study of these three priors. Ei Et /k(yt-l,yt, x, t). The discounted Figure 2: Shapes of prior distributions</paragraph>

                    <subtitle>2.1.1 Gaussian prior</subtitle>
                    <paragraph>With a Gaussian prior, log-likelihood (2) is penalized as follows: where ak is a variance. Maximizing (3) corresponds to satisfying</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>This adjusted constraint (as well as the adjustments imposed by the other two priors) is intuitively understandable: rather than matching exact empirical feature frequencies, the model is tuned to match discounted feature frequencies.  
                        <context>
                        <cite id="18" function="ack" polarity="neu">Chen and Rosenfeld (2000)</cite> discuss this in the context of other discounting procedures common in language modeling. 
                        </context>
                    We call the term subtracted from the empirical counts (in this case Ak/a) a discounted value.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>The variance can be feature dependent. However for simplicity, constant variance is often used for all features. in this paper, however, we experiment with several alternate versions of Gaussian prior in which the variance is feature dependent.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>Although Gaussian (and other) priors are gradually overcome by increasing amounts of training data, perhaps not at the right rate. The three methods below all provide ways to alter this rate by changing the variance of the Gaussian prior dependent on feature counts. 1. Threshold Cut: In language modeling, e.g, Good-Turing smoothing, only low frequency words are smoothed. Here we apply the same idea and only smooth those features whose frequencies are lower than a threshold (7 in our experiments, following standard practice in language modeling). 2. Divide Count: Here we let the discounted value for a feature depend on its frequency in the training value used here is where a is a constant over all features. In this way, we increase the smoothing on the low frequency features more so than the high frequency features. 3. Bin-Based: We divide features into classes based on frequency. We bin features by frequency in the training set, and let the features in the same bin share the same variance. The discounted value is set to be \ck/N] xa2 where ck is the count of features, N is the bin size, and [a] is the ceiling function. Alternatively, the variance in each bin may be set independently by cross-validation.</paragraph>

                    <paragraph>Whereas the Gaussian prior penalizes according to the square of the weights (an L2 penalizer), the intention here is to create a smoothly differentiable analogue to penalizing the absolute-value of the weights (an L1 penalizer). L1 penalizers often result in more "sparse solutions," in which many features have weight nearly at zero, and thus provide a kind of soft feature selection that improves generalization.</paragraph>

                    <paragraph>In CRFs, state transitions are also represented as features. The feature function fk(yt-1, yt, x, t) in Equ. (1) is a general function over states and observations. Different state transition features can be defined to form different Markov-order structures. We define four different state transitions features corresponding to different Markov order for different classes of features. Higher order features model dependencies better, but also create more data sparse problem and require more memory in training. 1. First-order: Here the inputs are examined in the context of the current state only. The feature functions are represented as f (yt, x). There are no separate parameters or preferences for state transitions at all. 2. First-order+transitions: Here we add parameters corresponding to state transitions. The feature functions used are f (yt, x), f (yt-i, yt). 3. Second-order: Here inputs are examined in the context of the current and previous states. Feature function are represented as f (yt-1, yt, x). 4. Third-order: Here inputs are examined in the context ofthe current, two previous states. Feature function are represented as f (yt-2, yt-i, yt, x).</paragraph>

                    <subtitle>2.2.2 Supported features and unsupported features</subtitle>
                    <paragraph>Before the use of prior distributions over parameters was common in maximum entropy classifiers, standard practice was to eliminate all features with zero count in the training data (the so-called unsupported features). However, unsupported, zero-count features can be extremely useful for pushing Viterbi inference away from certain paths by assigning such features negative weight. The use of a prior allows the incorporation of unsupported features, however, doing so often greatly increases the number parameters and thus the memory requirements.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>Below we experiment with models containing and not containing unsupported features—both with and without regularization by priors, and we argue that non-supported features are useful.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>We present here incremental support, a method of introducing some useful unsupported features without exploding the number of parameters with all unsupported features. The model is trained for several iterations with supported features only. Then inference determines the label sequences assigned high probability by the model. Incorrect transitions assigned high probability by the model are used to selectively add to the model those unsupported features that occur on those transitions, which may help improve performance by being assigned negative weight in future training. If desired, several iterations of this procedure may be performed.</paragraph>

                    <paragraph>One of the advantages of CRFs and maximum entropy models in general is that they easily afford the use ofarbi-trary features of the input. One can encode local spelling features, layout features such as positions of line breaks, as well as external lexicon features, all in one framework. We study all these features in our research paper extraction problem, evaluate their individual contributions, and give some guidelines for selecting good features.</paragraph>

In addition to the previously-used word accuracy measure (which overemphasizes accuracy of the abstract field), we use per-field F1 measure (both for individual fields and averaged over all fields—called a "macro average" in the information retrieval literature), and whole instance accuracy for measuring overall performance in a way that is sensitive to even a single error in any part of header or citation.</paragraph>

                    <paragraph>1. Word Accuracy: We define A as the number of true positive words, B as the number of false negative words, C as the number of false positive words, D as the number of true negative words, and A + B + C + D is the total number of words. Word accuracy is calculated to be a+sXc+d 2. F1-measure: Precision, recall and F1 measure are defined as follows. Precision = Recall = -pj _ 2 X Precision X Recall Precision^ Recall</paragraph>

                    <subtitle>3.3.2 Measuring overall performance</subtitle> 
                    <paragraph>1. Overall word accuracy: Overall word accuracy is the percentage of words whose predicted labels equal their true labels. Word accuracy favors fields with large number of words, such as the abstract. 2. Averaged F-measure: Averaged F-measure is computed by averaging the F1-measures over all fields. Average F-measure favors labels with small number of words, which complements word accuracy. Thus, we consider both word accuracy and average F-measure in evaluation. 3. Whole instance accuracy: An instance here is defined to be a single header or reference. Whole instance accuracy is the percentage of instances in which every word is correctly labeled.</paragraph>

                    The results we obtained with CRFs use second-order state transition features, layout features, as well as supported and unsupported features. Feature induction is used in experiments on dataset R; (it didn't improve accuracy on H). The results we obtained with the HMM model use a second order model for transitions, and a first order for observations.

                    <paragraph>
                        <context>
                        From Table (1, 2), one can see that CRF performs significantly better than HMMs, which again supports the previous findings (<cite id="37" function="ack" polarity="neu">Lafferty et al., 2001</cite>; <cite id="38" function="ack" polarity="neu">Pinto et al., 2003</cite>).
                        </context>
                        CRFs also perform significantly better than SVM-based approach, yielding new state of the art performance on this task. CRFs increase the performance on nearly all the fields. The overall word accuracy is improved from 92.9% to 98.3%, which corresponds to a 78% error rate reduction. However, as we can see word accuracy can be misleading since HMM model even has a higher word accuracy than SVM, although it performs much worse than SVM in most individual fields except abstract. Interestingly, HMM performs much better on abstract field (98% versus 93.8% F-measure) which pushes the overall accuracy up. A better comparison can be made by comparing the field-based F-measures. Here, in comparison to the SVM, CRFs improve the F1 measure from 89.7% to 93.9%, an error reduction of 36%. Table 1: Extraction results for paper headers onH</paragraph>

                    <subtitle>3.5.2 Effects of regularization</subtitle>
                    <paragraph>The results of different regularization methods are summarized in Table (3). Setting Gaussian variance of features depending on feature count performs better, from 90.5% to 91.2%, an error reduction of 7%, when only using supported features, and an error reduction of 9% when using supported and unsupported features. Results are averaged over 5 random runs, with an average variance of 0.2%. In our experiments we found the Gaussian prior to consistently perform better than the others. Surprisingly, exponential prior hurts the performance significantly. It over penalizes the likelihood (significantly increasing cost—defined as negative penalized log-likelihood). We hypothesized that the problem could be that the choice of constant a is inappropriate. So we tried varying a instead of computing it using absolute discounting, but found the alternatives to perform worse. These results suggest that Gaussian prior is a safer prior Table 3: Regularization comparisons: Gaussian infinity is non-regularized, Gaussian variance = X sets variance to be X. Gaussian cut 7 refers to the Threshold Cut method, Gaussian divide count refers to the Divide Count method, Gaussian bin N refers to the Bin-Based method with bin size equals N, as described in 2.1.1 to use in practice.</paragraph>

                    <subtitle>State transition features and unsupported features.</subtitle>
                    <paragraph>We summarize the comparison of different state transition models using or not using unsupported features in Table 4. The first column describes the four different state transition models, the second column contains the overall word accuracy of these models using only support features, and the third column contains the result of using all features, including unsupported features. Comparing the rows, one can see that the second-order model performs the best, but not dramatically better than the first-order+transitions and the third order model. However, the first-order model performs significantly worse. The difference does not come from sharing the weights, but from ignoringthe f (yt-i, yt). The first order transition feature is vital here. We would expect the third order model to perform better if enough training data were available.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>Comparing the second and the third columns, we can see that using all features including unsupported features, consistently performs better than ignoring them. Our preliminary experiments with incremental support have shown performance in between that of supported-only and all features, and are still ongoing.</paragraph>
                    <subtitle>Effects of layout features</subtitle>
                    <paragraph>To analyze the contribution of different kinds of features, we divide the features into three categories: local features, layout features, and external lexicon resources. The features we used are summarized in Table 5. Table 2: Extraction results for paper references onR Table 6: Results of using different features onH</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>The results of using different features are shown in Table 6. The layout feature dramatically increases the performance, raising the F1 measure from 88.8% to 93.9%, whole sentence accuracy from 40.1% to 72.4%. Adding lexicon features alone improves the performance. However, when combing lexicon features and layout features, the performance is worse than using layout features alone.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>The lexicons were gathered from a large collection of BibTeX files, and upon examination had difficult to remove noise, for example words in the author lexicon that were also affiliations. In previous work, we have gained significant benefits by dividing each lexicon into sections based on point-wise information gain with respect to the lexicon's class.</paragraph>

                    <paragraph>Table 7 is the classification confusion matrix of header extraction (field page is not shown to save space). Most errors happen at the boundaries between two fields. Especially the transition from author to affiliation, from abstract to keyword. The note field is the one most confused with others, and upon inspection is actually labeled inconsistently in the training data. Other errors could be fixed with additional feature engineering—for example, including additional specialized regular expressions should make email accuracy nearly perfect. Increasing the amount of training data would also be expected to help significantly, as indicated by consistent nearly perfect accuracy on the training set.</paragraph>

            <title>4 Conclusions and Future Work</title>
            <paragraph>This paper investigates the issues of regularization, feature spaces, and efficient use of unsupported features in CRFs, with an application to information extraction from research papers.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>For regularization we find that the Gaussian prior with variance depending on feature frequencies performs better than several other alternatives in the literature. Feature engineering is a key component of any machine learning solution—especially in conditionally-trained models with such freedom to choose arbitrary features—and plays an even more important role than regularization.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>We obtain new state-of-the-art performance in extracting standard fields from research papers, with a significant error reduction by several metrics. We also suggest better evaluation metrics to facilitate future research in this task—especially field-F1, rather than word accuracy.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>We have provided an empirical exploration of a few previously-published priors for conditionally-trained loglinear models. Fundamental advances in regularization for CRFs remains a significant open research area.</paragraph>
