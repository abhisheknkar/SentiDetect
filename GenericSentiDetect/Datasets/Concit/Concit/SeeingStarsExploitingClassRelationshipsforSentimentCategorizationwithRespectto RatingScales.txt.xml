            <paragraph> 
                We address the rating-inference problem, wherein rather than simply decide whether a review is "thumbs up" or "thumbs down", as in previous sentiment analysis work, one must determine an author's evaluation with respect to a multi-point scale (e.g., one to five "stars"). 
                This task represents an interesting twist on standard multi-class text categorization because there are several different degrees of similarity between class labels; for example, "three stars" is intuitively closer to "four stars" than to "one star".

            <paragraph> 
                We first evaluate human performance at the task. 
                Then, we apply a meta-algorithm, based on a metric labeling formulation of the problem, that alters a given n-ary classifier's output in an explicit attempt to ensure that similar items receive similar labels. 
                We show that the meta-algorithm can provide significant improvements over both multi-class and regression versions of SVMs when we employ a novel similarity measure appropriate to the problem.

            <title>1 Introduction</title> 
            <paragraph> 
                There has recently been a dramatic surge of interest in sentiment analysis, as more and more people become aware of the scientific challenges posed and the scope of new applications enabled by the processing of subjective language. 
                <context>    
                    (The papers collected by Qu, Shanahan, and <cite id="1" function="ack" polarity="neu">Wiebe (2004)</cite> form a representative sample of research in the area.)</context> 
                <context>Most prior work on the specific problem of categorizing expressly opinionated text has focused on the binary distinction of positive vs. negative (<cite id="2" function="ack" polarity="neu">Turney, 2002</cite>; <cite id="3" function="ack" polarity="neu">Pang, Lee, and Vaithyanathan, 2002</cite>; <cite id="4" function="ack" polarity="neu">Dave, Lawrence, and Pennock, 2003</cite>; <cite id="5" function="ack" polarity="neu">Yu and Hatzivas-siloglou, 2003</cite>).</context> 
                But it is often helpful to have more information than this binary distinction provides, especially if one is ranking items by recommendation or comparing several reviewers' opinions: example applications include collaborative filtering and deciding which conference submissions to accept. 
            </paragraph> 
            <paragraph> 
                Therefore, in this paper we consider generalizing to finer-grained scales: rather than just determine whether a review is "thumbs up" or not, we attempt to infer the author's implied numerical rating, such as "three stars" or "four stars". 
                <context>Note that this differs from identifying opinion strength (<cite id="6" function="ack" polarity="neu">Wilson, Wiebe, and Hwa, 2004</cite>):</context> rants and raves have the same strength but represent opposite evaluations, and referee forms often allow one to indicate that one is very confident (high strength) that a conference submission is mediocre (middling rating).
                Also, our task differs from ranking not only because one can be given a single item to classify (as opposed to a set of items to be ordered relative to one another), but because there are settings in which classification is harder than ranking, and vice versa. 
            </paragraph> 
            <paragraph> 
                One can apply standard n-ary classifiers or regression to this rating-inference problem; <context>independent <paper>work</paper>

                <context>But an <method>alternative approach</method> that explicitly incorporates information about item similarities together with label similarity information (for instance, "one star" is closer to "two stars" than to "four stars") <kw>is to think of</kw> the task as one of <task>metric labeling</task> (<cite id="8" function="use" polarity="neu">Kleinberg and Tardos, 2002</cite>), where label relations are encoded via a distance metric. </context>
                This observation yields a meta-algorithm, applicable to both semi-supervised (via graph-theoretic techniques) and supervised settings, that alters a given n-ary classifier's output so that similar items tend to be assigned similar labels. 
            </paragraph> 
            <paragraph> 
                In what follows, we first demonstrate that humans can discern relatively small differences in (hidden) evaluation scores, indicating that rating inference is indeed a meaningful task. 
                We then present three types of algorithms — one-vs-all, regression, and metric labeling — that can be distinguished by how explicitly they attempt to leverage similarity between items and between labels. 
                Next, we consider what item similarity measure to apply, proposing one based on the positive-sentence percentage. 
                Incorporating this new measure within the metric-labeling framework is shown to often provide significant improvements over the other algorithms.

            <title>2 Problem validation and formulation</title> 
            <paragraph> 
                We first ran a small pilot study on human subjects in order to establish a rough idea of what a reasonable classification granularity is: if even people cannot accurately infer labels with respect to a five-star scheme with half stars, say, then we cannot expect a learning algorithm to do so. 
                Indeed, some potential obstacles to accurate rating inference include lack of calibration (e.g., what an understated author intends as high praise may seem lukewarm), author inconsistency at assigning fine-grained ratings, and 
                Table 1: Human accuracy at determining relative positivity. 
                Rating differences are given in "notches". 
                Parentheses enclose the number of pairs attempted. 
                ratings not entirely supported by the text. 
            </paragraph> 
            <paragraph> 
                For data, we first collected Internet movie reviews in English from four authors, removing explicit rating indicators from each document's text automatically. 
                Now, while the obvious experiment would be to ask subjects to guess the rating that a review represents, doing so would force us to specify a fixed rating-scale granularity in advance. 
                Instead, we examined people's ability to discern relative differences, because by varying the rating differences represented by the test instances, we can evaluate multiple granularities in a single experiment. 
                Specifically, at intervals over a number of weeks, we authors (a non-native and a native speaker of English) examined pairs of reviews, attemping to determine whether the first review in each pair was (1) more positive than, (2) less positive than, or (3) as positive as the second. 
                The texts in any particular review pair were taken from the same author to factor out the effects of cross-author divergence. 
            </paragraph> 
            <paragraph> 
                As Table 1 shows, both subjects performed perfectly when the rating separation was at least 3 "notches" in the original scale (we define a notch as a half star in a four- or five-star scheme and 10 points in a 100-point scheme). 
                Interestingly, although human performance drops as rating difference decreases, even at a one-notch separation, both subjects handily outperformed the random-choice baseline of 33%. 
                However, there was large variation in accuracy between subjects. 
                'For example, the critic Dennis Schwartz writes that "sometimes the review itself [indicates] the letter grade should have been higher or lower, as the review might fail to take into consideration my overall impression of the film — which I hope to capture in the grade" (http://www.sover.net/~ozus/cinema.htm). 
                One contributing factor may be that the subjects viewed disjoint document sets, since we wanted to maximize experimental coverage of the types of document pairs within each difference class. 
                We thus cannot report inter-annotator agreement, 
            </paragraph> 
            <paragraph> 
                Because of this variation, we defined two different classification regimes. 
                From the evidence above, a three-class task (categories 0, 1, and 2 — essentially "negative", "middling", and "positive", respectively) seems like one that most people would do quite well at (but we should not assume 100% human accuracy: according to our one-notch results, people may misclassify borderline cases like 2.5 stars). 
                Our study also suggests that people could do at least fairly well at distinguishing full stars in a zero- to four-star scheme. 
                However, when we began to construct five-category datasets for each of our four authors (see below), we found that in each case, either the most negative or the most positive class (but not both) contained only about 5% of the documents. 
                To make the classes more balanced, we folded these minority classes into the adjacent class, thus arriving at a four-class problem (categories 0-3, increasing in positivity). 
                Note that the four-class problem seems to offer more possibilities for leveraging class relationship information than the three-class setting, since it involves more class pairs. 
                <context>Also, even the two-category version of the rating-inference problem for <task>movie reviews</task> 
                    <kw>has proven quite challenging for</kw> many automated classification <method>techniques</method> (Pang, <cite id="14" function="ack" polarity="neu">Lee, and Vaithyanathan, 2002</cite>; <cite id="15" function="ack" polarity="neu">Turney, 2002</cite>).</context>
            </paragraph> 
            <paragraph> 
                We applied the above two labeling schemes to a scale dataset containing four corpora of movie reviews. 
                <context>All reviews were automatically pre-processed to remove both explicit rating indicators and objective sentences; the motivation for the latter step is that it has previously aided positive vs. negative classification (<cite id="16" function="ack" polarity="neu">Pang and Lee, 2004</cite>).</context>
                All of the 1770, 902, 1307, or 1027 documents in a given corpus were written by the same author. 
                This decision facilitates interpretation of the results, since it factors out the effects of different choices of methods for calibrating authors' scales. 
                We point out that 
                but since our goal is to recover a reviewer's "true" recommendation, reader-author agreement is more relevant. 
                While another factor might be degree of English fluency, in an informal experiment (six subjects viewing the same three pairs), native English speakers made the only two errors.

                From the Rotten Tomatoes website's FAQ: "star systems are not consistent between critics. 
                For critics like Roger Ebert and James Berardinelli, 2.5 stars or lower out of 4 stars is always negative. 
                For other critics, 2.5 stars can either be positive 
                it is possible to gather author-specific information in some practical applications: for instance, systems that use selected authors (e.g., the Rotten Tomatoes movie-review website — where, we note, not all authors provide explicit ratings) could require that someone submit rating-labeled samples of newly-admitted authors' work. 
                Moreover, our results at least partially generalize to mixed-author situations (see Section 5.2).

            <paragraph> 
                Recall that the problem we are considering is multi-category classification in which the labels can be naturally mapped to a metric space (e.g., points on a line); for simplicity, we assume the distance metric throughout. 
                In this section, we present three approaches to this problem in order of increasingly explicit use of pairwise similarity information between items and between labels. 
                In order to make comparisons between these methods meaningful, we base all three of them on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) as implemented in Joachims' (1999) SVMK»W package.

                    Also, let be a distance metric on labels, and let denote the nearest neighbors of item according to some item-similarity function .

                    Aside: transduction The above formulation also allows for transductive semi-supervised learning as well, in that we could allow nearest neighbors to come from both the training and test sets. 
                    We intend to address this case in future work, since there are important settings in which one has a small number of labeled reviews and a large number of unlabeled reviews, in which case considering similarities between unlabeled texts could prove quite helpful.

                shows that in aggregate, the vocabularies of distant classes overlap to a degree surprisingly similar to that of the vocabularies of nearby classes. 
                Thus, item similarity as measured by TO(cos) may not correlate well with similarity of the item's true labels. 
            </paragraph> 
            <paragraph> 
                We can potentially develop a more useful similarity metric by asking ourselves what, intuitively, accounts for the label relationships that we seek to exploit. 
                A simple hypothesis is that ratings can be determined by the positive-sentence percentage (PSP) of a text, i.e., the number of positive sentences divided by the number of subjective sentences. 
                <context>(<method>Term-based versions</method> of this premise <kw>have motivated</kw> much <paper>sentiment-analysis work</paper> for over a decade (<cite id="29" function="use" polarity="neu">Das and Chen, 2001</cite>; <cite id="30" function="use" polarity="neu">Tong, 2001</cite>; <cite id="31" function="use" polarity="neu">Turney, 2002</cite>).)</context>
                But counterexamples are easy to construct: reviews can contain off-topic opinions, or recount many positive aspects before describing a fatal flaw. 
            </paragraph> 
            <paragraph> 
                We therefore tested the hypothesis as follows. 
                To avoid the need to hand-label sentences as positive or negative, we first created a sentence polarity dataset consisting of 10,662 movie-review "snippets" (a striking extract usually one sentence long) downloaded from www.rottentomatoes.com; each snippet was labeled with its source review's label (positive or negative) as provided by Rotten Tomatoes. 
                Then, we trained a Naive Bayes classifier on this data set and applied it to our scale dataset to identify the positive sentences (recall that objective sentences were already removed). 
            </paragraph> 
            <paragraph> 
                Figure 1 shows that all four authors tend to exhibit a higher PSP when they write a more positive review, and we expect that most typical reviewers would follow suit. 
                Hence, PSP appears to be a promising basis for computing document similarity for our rating-inference task. 
                In particular, we defined PSP(x) to be the two-dimensional vector , and then set the itemsimilarity function required by the metric-labeling optimization function (Section 3.3) to sim(x,y) =

            <paragraph> 
                But before proceeding, we note that it is possible that similarity information might yield no extra benefit at all. 
                For instance, we don't need it if we can reliably identify each class just from some set of distinguishing terms. 
                If we define such terms as frequent ones ( ) that appear in a single class 50% or more of the time, then we do find many instances; some examples for one author are: "meaningless", "disgusting" (class 0); "pleasant", "uneven" (class 1); and "oscar", "gem" (class 2) for the three-class case, and, in the four-class case, "flat", "tedious" (class 1) versus "straightforward", "likeable" (class 2). 
                Some unexpected distinguishing terms for this author are "lion" for class 2 (three-class case), and for class 2 in the four-class case, "jennifer", for a wide variety of Jennifers.

            <paragraph> 
                This section compares the accuracies of the approaches outlined in Section 3 on the four corpora comprising our scale dataset. 
                (Results using error were qualitatively similar.) 
                Throughout, when we refer to something as "significant", we mean statistically so with respect to the paired -test, . 
            </paragraph> 
            <paragraph> 
                The results that follow are based on 's default parameter settings for SVM regression and OVA. 
                Preliminary analysis of the effect of varying the regression parameter in the four-class case revealed that the default value was often optimal. 
                While admittedly we initially chose this function because it was convenient to work with cosines, post hoc analysis revealed that the corresponding metric space "stretched" certain distances in a useful way. 
            </paragraph> 
            <paragraph> 
                The notation "A B" denotes metric labeling where method A provides the initial label preference function and B serves as similarity measure. 
                To train, we first select the meta-parameters and a by running 9-fold cross-validation within the training set. 
                Fixing and to those values yielding the best performance, we then re-train A (but with SVM parameters fixed, as described above) on the whole training set. 
                At test time, the nearest neighbors of each item are also taken from the full training set. 
            </paragraph> 
            <subsection> 
                <title>5.1 Main comparison</title> 
                <paragraph> 
                    Figure 2 summarizes our average 10-fold cross-validation accuracy results. 
                    We first observe from the plots that all the algorithms described in Section 3 always definitively outperform the simple baseline of predicting the majority class, although the improvements are smaller in the four-class case. 
                    Incidentally, the data was distributed in such a way that the absolute performance of the baseline itself does not change much between the three- and four-class case (which implies that the three-class datasets were relatively more balanced); and Author c's datasets seem noticeably easier than the others. 
                </paragraph> 
                <paragraph> 
                    We now examine the effect of implicitly using label and item similarity. 
                    In the four-class case, regression performed better than OVA (significantly so for two authors, as shown in the righthand table); but for the three-category task, OVA significantly outperforms regression for all four authors. 
                    One might initially interprete this "flip" as showing that in the four-class scenario, item and label similarities provide a richer source of information relative to class-specific characteristics, especially since for the non-majority classes there is less data available; whereas in the three-class setting the categories are better modeled as quite distinct entities. 
                </paragraph> 
                <paragraph> 
                    However, the three-class results for metric labeling on top of OVA and regression (shown in Figure 2 by black versions of the corresponding icons) show that employing explicit similarities always improves results, often to a significant degree, and yields the best overall accuracies. 
                    Thus, we can in fact effectively exploit similarities in the three-class case. 
                    Additionally, in both the three- and four- class scenarios, metric labeling often brings the performance of the weaker base method up to that of the stronger one (as indicated by the "disappearance" of upward triangles in corresponding table rows), and never hurts performance significantly. 
                </paragraph> 
                <paragraph> 
                    In the four-class case, metric labeling and regression seem roughly equivalent. 
                    One possible interpretation is that the relevant structure of the problem is already captured by linear regression (and perhaps a different kernel for regression would have improved its three-class performance). 
                    However, according to additional experiments we ran in the four-class situation, the test-set-optimal parameter settings for metric labeling would have produced significant improvements, indicating there may be greater potential for our framework. 
                    At any rate, we view the fact that metric labeling performed quite well for both rating scales as a definitely positive result. 
                </paragraph> 
                <title>5.2 Further discussion</title> 
                <paragraph> 
                    Q: Metric labeling looks like it's just combining SVMs with nearest neighbors, and classifier combination often improves performance. 
                    Couldn't we get the same kind of results by combining SVMs with any other reasonable method? 
                </paragraph> 
                <paragraph> 
                    A: No. 
                    For example, if we take the strongest base SVM method for initial label preferences, but replace PSP with the term-overlap-based cosine (TO(cos)), performance often drops significantly. 
                    This result, which is in accordance with Section 4's data, suggests that choosing an item similarity function that correlates well with label similarity is important. 
                    (ova+PSP &lt;m&lt;i&lt;i ova+TO(cos) [3c]; reg+PSP &lt;! reg+TO(cos) [4c]) Q: Could you explain that notation, please? 
                    A: Triangles point toward the significantly better algorithm for some dataset. 
                    For instance, "M N [3c]" means, "In the 3-class task, method M is significantly better than N for two author datasets and significantly worse for one dataset (so the algorithms were statistically indistinguishable on the remaining dataset)". 
                    When the algorithms being compared are statistically indistinguishable on Average accuracies, three-class data Average accuracies, four-class data

                    Open icons: SVMs in either one-versus-all (square) or regression (circle) mode; dark versions: metric labeling using the corresponding SVM together with the positive-sentence percentage (PSP).

                    Triangles point towards significantly better algorithms for the results plotted above. 
                    Specifically, if the difference between a row and a column algorithm for a given author dataset (a, b, c, or d) is significant, a triangle points to the better one; otherwise, a dot (.) is shown. 
                    Dark icons highlight the effect of adding PSP information via metric labeling.

                <paragraph> 
                    Q: Thanks. 
                    Doesn't Figure 1 show that the positive-sentence percentage would be a good classifier even in isolation, so metric labeling isn't necessary? 
                </paragraph> 
                <paragraph> 
                    A: No. Predicting class labels directly from the PSP value via trained thresholds isn't as effective (ova PSP threshold PSP [3c]; reg PSP threshold PSP [4c]). 
                    Alternatively, we could use only the PSP component of metric labeling by setting the label preference function to the constant function 0, but even with test-set-optimal parameter settings, doing so underperforms the trained metric labeling algorithm with access to an initial SVM classifier (ova+PSP «« 0+PSP* [3c]; reg PSP 0 [4c]). 
                </paragraph> 
                <paragraph> 
                    Q: What about using PSP as one of the features for input to a standard classifier? 
                    A: Our focus is on investigating the utility of similarity information. 
                    In our particular rating-inference setting, it so happens that the basis for our pair-wise similarity measure can be incorporated as an item-specific feature, but we view this as a tangential issue. 
                    That being said, preliminary experiments show that metric labeling can be better, barely (for test-set-optimal parameter settings for both algorithms: significantly better results for one author, four-class case; statistically indistinguishable otherwise), although one needs to determine an appropriate weight for the PSP feature to get good performance. 
                </paragraph> 
                <paragraph> 
                    Q: You defined the "metric transformation" function as the identity function , imposing greater loss as the distance between labels assigned to two similar items increases. 
                    Can you do just as well if you penalize all non-equal label assignments by the same amount, or does the distance between labels really matter? 
                    A: You're asking for a comparison to the Potts model, which sets to the function ting in which there is a significant difference between the two, the Potts model does worse (ova PSP ova PSP [3c]). 
                    Also, employing the Potts model generally leads to fewer significant improvements over a chosen base method (compare Figure 2's tables with: reg PSP reg [3c]; ova PSP ova [3c]; ova PSP ova [4c]; but note that reg PSP reg [4c]). 
                    We note that optimizing the Potts model in the multi-label case is NP-hard, whereas the optimal metric labeling with the identity metric-transformation function can be efficiently obtained (see Section 3.3). 
                </paragraph> 
                <paragraph> 
                    Q: Your datasets had many labeled reviews and only one author each. 
                    Is your work relevant to settings with many authors but very little data for each? 
                    A: As discussed in Section 2, it can be quite difficult to properly calibrate different authors' scales, since the same number of "stars" even within what is ostensibly the same rating system can mean different things for different authors. 
                    But since you ask: we temporarily turned a blind eye to this serious issue, creating a collection of 5394 reviews by 496 authors with at most 80 reviews per author, where we pretended that our rating conversions mapped correctly into a universal rating scheme. 
                    Preliminary results on this dataset were actually comparable to the results reported above, although since we are not confident in the class labels themselves, more 
                    In future work, it would be interesting to determine author-independent characteristics that can be used on (or suitably adapted to) data for specific authors.

                <paragraph> 
                    Q: How about trying — A: —Yes, there are many alternatives. 
                    A few that we tested are described in the Appendix, and we propose some others in the next section. 
                    We should mention that we have not yet experimented with all-vs.-all (AVA), another standard binary-to-multi-category classifier conversion method, because we wished to focus on the effect of omitting pairwise information.

            <title>6 Related work and future directions</title> 
            <paragraph> 
                In this paper, we addressed the rating-inference problem, showing the utility of employing label similarity and (appropriate choice of) item similarity — either implicitly, through regression, or explicitly and often more effectively, through metric labeling. 
            </paragraph> 
            <paragraph> 
                In the future, we would like to apply our methods to other scale-based classification problems, and explore alternative methods. 
                Clearly, varying the kernel in SVM regression might yield better results. 
                Another choice is <method>ordinal regression</method> (<cite id="34">McCullagh, 1980</cite>; Herbrich, <cite id="35" function="wea" polarity="neg">Graepel, and Obermayer, 2000</cite>), which <kw>only considers</kw> the <feature>ordering on labels</feature>, <negfeature>rather than</negfeature> any explicit distances between them; this approach could work well if a good metric on labels is lacking. 
                Also, <person>one</person> 
                <kw>could use</kw> 
                <method>mixture models</method> (e.g., combine "positive" and "negative" language models) to capture class relationships (<cite id="36" function="use" polarity="neu">McCallum, 1999</cite>; <cite id="37" function="use" polarity="neu">Schapire and Singer, 2000</cite>; Takamura, <cite id="38" function="use" polarity="neu">Matsumoto, and Yamada, 2004</cite>). 
            </paragraph> 
            <paragraph> 
                We are also interested in framing multi-class but non-scale-based categorization problems as metric labeling tasks. 
                <context>For example, positive vs. negative vs. neutral sentiment distinctions are sometimes considered in which neutral means either objective (<cite id="39" function="ack" polarity="neu">Engstrom, 2004</cite>) or a conflation of objective with a rating of mediocre (<cite id="40" function="ack" polarity="neu">Das and Chen, 2001</cite>). </context>
                (Koppel and <cite id="41" function="ack" polarity="neu">Schler (2005)</cite> in independent work also discuss various types of neutrality.) 
                In either case, we could apply a metric in which positive and negative are closer to objective (or objective+mediocre) than to each other. 
                As another example, hierarchical label relationships can be easily encoded in a label metric. 
            </paragraph> 
            <paragraph> 
                Finally, as mentioned in Section 3.3, we would like to address the transductive setting, in which one has a small amount of labeled data and uses relationships between unlabeled items, since it is particularly well-suited to the metric-labeling approach and may be quite important in practice.
