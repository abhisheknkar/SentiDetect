            <paragraph> 
                We analyze collective discourse, a collective human behavior in content generation, and show that it exhibits diversity, a property of general collective systems. Using extensive analysis, we propose a novel paradigm for designing summary generation systems that reflect the diversity of perspectives seen in real-life collective summarization. We analyze 50 sets of summaries written by human about the same story or artifact and investigate the diversity of perspectives across these summaries. We show how different summaries use various phrasal information units (i.e., nuggets) to express the same atomic semantic units, called factoids. Finally, we present a ranker that employs distributional similarities to build a network of words, and captures the diversity of perspectives by detecting communities in this network. Our experiments show how our system outperforms a wide range of other document ranking systems that leverage diversity.

            <paragraph> 
                <context>
                    In sociology, the term collective behavior is used to denote mass activities that are not centrally coordinated (<cite id="1" function="ack" polarity="neu">Blumer, 1951</cite>)
                </context>
                
                <context>
                    . Collective behavior is different from group behavior in the following ways: (a) it involves limited social interaction, (b) membership is fluid, and (c) it generates weak and unconventional norms (<cite id="2" function="ack" polarity="neu">Smelser, 1963</cite>).    
                </context>
                

                In this paper, we focus on the computational analysis of collective discourse, a collective behavior seen in interactive content contribution and text summarization in online social media. In collective discourse each individual's behavior is largely independent of that of other individuals.

                    In social media, discourse (<cite id="3" function="ack" polarity="neu">Grosz and Sidner, 1986</cite>) is often a collective reaction to an event. 
                </context>
                
                One scenario leading to collective reaction to a well-defined subject is when an event occurs (a movie is released, a story occurs, a paper is published) and people independently write about it (movie reviews, news headlines, citation sentences). This process of content generation happens over time, and each person chooses the aspects to cover. Each event has an onset and a time of death after which nothing is written about it. Tracing the generation of content over many instances will reveal temporal patterns that will allow us to make sense of the text generated around a particular event. 
            </paragraph> 
            <paragraph> 
                To understand collective discourse, we are interested in behavior that happens over a short period of time. We focus on topics that are relatively well-defined in scope such as a particular event or a single news event that does not evolve over time. This can eventually be extended to events and issues that are evolving either in time or scope such as elections, wars, or the economy.

                    We believe that out experiments will give insight into new models of text generation, which is aimed at modeling the process of producing natural language texts, and is best characterized as the process of making choices between alternate linguistic realizations, also known as lexical choice (<cite id="7" function="ack" polarity="neu">Elhadad, 1995</cite>; Barzi-lay and <cite id="8" function="ack" polarity="neu">Lee, 2002</cite>; <cite id="9" function="ack" polarity="neu">Stede, 1995</cite>).

                Their random walk formulation is to score sentences and pairs of sentences from opposite viewpoints (clusters) based on both their representativeness of the collection as well as their contrastiveness with each other. Once a lexical similarity graph is built, they modify the graph based on cluster information and perform LexRank on the modified cosine similarity graph.

                The datasets used in our experiments represent two completely different categories: news headlines, and scientific citation sentences. The headlines datasets consist of 25 clusters of news headlines collected from Google News, and the citations datasets have 25 clusters of citations to specific scientific papers from the ACL Anthology Network (AAN). Each cluster consists of a number of unique summaries (headlines or citations) about the same artifact (non-evolving news story or scientific paper) written by different people. Table 1 lists some of the clusters with the number of summaries in them. Table 1: Some of the annotated datasets and the number of summaries in each of them (hdl = headlines; cit = citations)

                <subtitle>3.1 Nuggets vs. Factoids</subtitle> 
                <paragraph> 
                    We define an annotation task that requires explicit definitions that distinguish between phrases that represent the same or different information units. 
                    <context>
                        Unfortunately, there is little consensus in the literature on such definitions. Therefore, <author>we</author> 
                        <kw>follow</kw>  
                        <cite id="31" function="bas" polarity="neu">(van Halteren and Teufel, 2003</cite>) and make the following distinction.
                    </context>
                    We define a nugget to be a phrasal information unit. Different nuggets may all represent the same atomic semantic unit, which we call as a factoid. In the following headlines, which are randomly extracted from the redsox dataset, nuggets are manually underlined. red sox win 2007 world series boston red sox blank rockies to clinch world series news.google.com http://clair.si.umich.edu/clair/anthology/ boston fans celebrate world series win; 37 arrests reported These 3 headlines contain 9 nuggets, which represent 5 factoids or classes of equivalent nuggets. fi : {red sox, boston, boston red sox} f2 : {2007 world series, world series win, world series} f5 : {fans celebrate} 
                </paragraph> 
                <paragraph> 
                    This example suggests that different headlines on the same story written independently of one another use different phrases (nuggets) to refer to the same semantic unit (e.g., "red sox" vs. "boston" vs. "boston red sox") or to semantic units corresponding to different aspects of the story (e.g., "37 arrests" vs. "rockies"). In the former case different nuggets are used to represent the same factoid, while in the latter case different nuggets are used to express different factoids.

                    The following citation sentences to Koehn's work suggest that a similar phenomenon also happens in citations.

                    Koehn et al (2003) suggest limiting phrase length to three words or less. For further information on these parameter settings, confer (koehn et al, 2003). where the first author mentions "pharaoh" as a contribution of Koehn et al, but the second and third use different nuggets to represent the same contribution: use of trigrams. However, as the last citation shows, a citation sentence, unlike news headlines, may cover no information about the target paper. 
                </paragraph> 
                <paragraph> 
                    The use of phrasal information as nuggets is an essential element to our experiments, since some headline writers often try to use uncommon terms to refer to a factoid. For instance, two headlines from the redsox cluster are: Short wait for bossox this time Soxcess started upstairs 
                </paragraph> 
                <paragraph> 
                    Following these examples, we asked two anno-tators to annotate all 1,390 headlines, and 926 citations. The annotators were asked to follow precise guidelines in nugget extraction. Our guidelines instructed annotators to extract non-overlapping phrases from each headline as nuggets. Therefore, each nugget should be a substring of the headline that represents a semantic unit.

                        Previously (<cite id="34" function="ack" polarity="neu">Lin and Hovy, 2002</cite>) had shown that information overlap judgment is a difficult task for human annotators. 
                    </context>
                    To avoid such a difficulty, we enforced our annotators to extract non-overlapping nuggets from a summary to make sure that they are mutually independent and that information overlap between them is minimized. 
                </paragraph> 
                <paragraph> 
                    Finding agreement between annotated well-defined nuggets is straightforward and can be calculated in terms of Kappa. However, when nuggets themselves are to be extracted by annotators, the task becomes less obvious. To calculate the agreement, we annotated 10 randomly selected headline clusters twice and designed a simple evaluation scheme based on Kappa. For each n-gram, w, in a given headline, we look if w is part of any nugget in either human annotations. If w occurs in both or neither, then the two annotators agree on it, and otherwise they do not. Based on this agreement setup, we can formalize the k statistic as k = Pr1—prpr)6'> where Pr(a) is the relative observed agreement among annotators, and Pr(e) is the probability that annotators agree by chance if each annotator is randomly assigning categories. 
                </paragraph> 
                <paragraph> 
                    Table 2 shows the unigram, bigram, and trigram-based average k between the two human annotators (Humanl, Human2). These results suggest that human annotators can reach substantial agreement when bigram and trigram nuggets are examined, and has reasonable agreement for unigram nuggets.

                <title>4.1 Skewed Distributions</title> 
                <paragraph> 
                    Our first experiment is to analyze the popularity of different factoids. For each factoid in the annotated clusters, we extract its count, X, which is equal to the number of summaries it has been mentioned in, and then we look at the distribution of X. Figure 1 shows the cumulative probability distribution for these counts (i.e., the probability that a factoid will be mentioned in at least c different summaries) in both categories. 
                </paragraph>

                    These highly skewed distributions indicate that a large number of factoids (more than 28%) are only mentioned once across different clusters (e.g., "poor pitching of colorado" in the redsox cluster), and that a few factoids are mentioned in a large number of headlines (likely using different nuggets). The large number of factoids that are only mentioned in one headline indicates that different summarizers increase diversity by focusing on different aspects of a story or a paper. The set of nuggets also exhibit similar skewed distributions. If we look at individual nuggets, the redsox set shows that about 63 (or 80%) of the nuggets get mentioned in only one headline, resulting in a right-skewed distribution.

                <paragraph> 
                    The factoid analysis of the datasets reveals two main causes for the content diversity seen in headlines: (1) writers focus on different aspects of the story and therefore write about different factoids (e.g., "celebrations" vs. "poor pitching of colorado"). (2) writer use different nuggets to represent the same factoid (e.g., "redsox" vs. "bosox"). In the following sections we analyze the extent at which each scenario happens. headlines number of summaries Figure 2: The number of unique factoids and nuggets observed by reading n random summaries in all the clusters of each category

                <paragraph> 
                    The emergence of diversity in covering different factoids suggests that looking at more summaries will capture a larger number of factoids. In order to analyze the growth of the factoid inventory, we perform a simple experiment. We shuffle the set of summaries from all 25 clusters in each category, and then look at the number of unique factoids and nuggets seen after reading nth summary. This number shows the amount of information that a randomly selected subset of n writers represent. This is important to study in order to find out whether we need a large number of summaries to capture all aspects of a story and build a complete factoid inventory. The plot in Figure 4.1 shows, at each n, the number of unique factoids and nuggets observed by reading n random summaries from the 25 clusters in each category. These curves are plotted on a semi-log scale to emphasize the difference between the growth patterns of the nugget inventories and the factoid inventories.

                    In their work, van Halteren and Teufel indicated that more than 10-20 human summaries are needed for a full factoid inventory. However, our experiments with nuggets of nearly 2, 400 independent human summaries suggest that neither the nugget inventory nor the number of factoids will be likely to show asymptotic behavior. However, these plots show that the nugget inventory grows at a much faster rate than factoids. This means that a lot of the diversity seen in human summarization is a result of the so called different lexical choices that represent the same semantic units or factoids.

                <title>4.3 Summary Quality</title> 
                <paragraph> 
                    In previous sections we gave evidence for the diversity seen in human summaries. However, a more important question to answer is whether these summaries all cover important aspects of the story. Here, we examine the quality of these summaries, study the distribution of information coverage in them, and investigate the number of summaries required to build a complete factoid inventory. 
                </paragraph> 
                <paragraph> 
                    The information covered in each summary can be determined by the set of factoids (and not nuggets) and their frequencies across the datasets. For example, in the redsox dataset, "red sox", "boston", and "boston red sox" are nuggets that all represent the same piece of information: the red sox team. Therefore, different summaries that use these nuggets to refer to the red sox team should not be seen as very different. 
                </paragraph> 
                <paragraph> 
                    We use the Pyramid model (Nenkova and Pas-sonneau, 2004) to value different summary factoids. Intuitively, factoids that are mentioned more frequently are more salient aspects of the story. Therefore, our pyramid model uses the normalized frequency at which a factoid is mentioned across a dataset as its weight. In the pyramid model, the individual factoids fall in tiers. If a factoid appears in more summaries, it falls in a higher tier. In principle, if the term wj appears jw^j times in the set of headlines it is assigned to the tier T\w. \. The pyramid score that we use is computed as follows. Suppose the pyramid has n tiers, Ti, where tier Tn is the top tier and T1 is the bottom. The weight of the factoids in tier Ti will be i (i.e. they appeared in i summaries). If \!T \! denotes the number of factoids in tier Ti, and Di is the number of factoids in the summary that appear in Ti, then the total factoid weight for the summary is D = ^n=1 i x Di. Additionally, the optimal pyramid score for a summary is Max = Y1 n=1 i x \!Ti\!. Finally, the pyramid score for a summary can be calculated as Similar experiment using individual clusters exhibit similar behavior 
                </paragraph> 
                <paragraph> 
                    Based on this scoring scheme, we can use the annotated datasets to determine the quality of individual headlines. First, for each set we look at the variation in pyramid scores that individual summaries obtain in their set. Figure 3 shows, for each cluster, the variation in the pyramid scores (25th to 75th percentile range) of individual summaries evaluated against the factoids of that cluster. This figure indicates that the pyramid score of almost all summaries obtain values with high variations in most of the clusters For instance, individual headlines from redsox obtain pyramid scores as low as 0.00 and as high as 0.93. This high variation confirms the previous observations on diversity of information coverage in different summaries. 
                </paragraph> 
                <paragraph> 
                    Additionally, this figure shows that headlines generally obtain higher values than citations when considered as summaries. One reason, as explained before, is that a citation may not cover any important contribution of the paper it is citing, when headlines generally tend to cover some aspects of the story. 
                </paragraph> 
                <paragraph> 
                    High variation in quality means that in order to capture a larger information content we need to read a greater number of summaries. But how many headlines should one read to capture a desired level of information content? To answer this question, we perform an experiment based on drawing random summaries from the pool of all the clusters in each category. We perform a Monte Carlo simulation, in which for each n, we draw n random summaries, and look at the pyramid score achieved by reading these headlines. The pyramid score is calculated using the factoids from all 25 clusters in each category. Each experiment is repeated 1, 000 times to find the statistical significance of the experiment and the variation from the average pyramid scores. 
                </paragraph> 
                <paragraph> 
                    Figure 4.3 shows the average pyramid scores over different n values in each category on a log-log scale. This figure shows how pyramid score grows and approaches 1 . 00 rapidly as more randomly selected summaries are seen. E >.

            <paragraph> 
                In previous sections we showed that the diversity seen in human summaries could be according to different nuggets or phrases that represent the same factoid. Ideally, a summarizer that seeks to increase diversity should capture this phenomenon and avoid covering redundant nuggets. In this section, we use different state of the art summarization systems to rank the set of summaries in each cluster with respect to information content and diversity. To evaluate each system, we cut the ranked list at a constant length (in terms of the number of words) and calculate the pyramid score of the remaining text.

                <paragraph> 
                    We have designed a summary ranker that will produce a ranked list of documents with respect to the diversity of their contents. Our model works based on ranking individual words and using the ranked list of words to rank documents that contain them.

                    We represent each word by its context in the cluster and find the similarity of such contexts. Particularly, each word wi is represented by a bag of words, li, that have a surface distance of 3 or smaller to wi anywhere in the cluster. In other words, li contains any word that co-occurs with wi in a 4-gram in the cluster. This bag of words representation of words enables us to find the word-pair similarities. 
                </paragraph> 
                <paragraph> 
                    We use the pair-wise similarities of words in each cluster, and build a network of words and their similarities. Intuitively, words that appear in similar contexts are more similar to each other and will have a stronger edge between them in the network. Therefore, similar words, or words that appear in similar contexts, will form communities in this graph. Ideally, each community in the word similarity network would represent a factoid.

                    The community detection algorithm will assign to each word wi, a community label Ci.For each community, we use LexRank to rank the words using the similarities in Equation 1, and assign a score to each word wi as S(wi) = , where Ri is the rank of wi in its community, and \! Ci \! is the number of words that belong to Ci. Figure 5.1 shows part "police unhappy celebrations ^—Sweeps Qnd O Witle —Second pitching jump glory oasebal!

This figure illustrates how words that are se-mantically related to the same aspects of the story fall in the same communities (e.g., "police" and "arrest"). Finally, to rank sentences, we define the score of each document Dj as the sum of the scores of its words.

                <paragraph> 
                    Intuitively, sentences that contain higher ranked words in highly populated communities will have a smaller score. To rank the sentences, we sort them in an ascending order, and cut the list when its size is greater than the length limit.

                        For each cluster in each category (citations and headlines), this method simply gets a random permutations of the summaries. In the headlines datasets, where most of the headlines cover some factoids about the story, we expect this method to perform reasonably well since randomization will increase the chances of covering headlines that focus on different factoids. However, in the citations dataset, where a citing sentence may cover no information about the cited paper, randomization has the drawback of selecting citations that have no valuable information in them.

                    <paragraph> 
                        Unlike other time-homogeneous random walks (e.g., PageRank), DivRank does not assume that the transition probabilities remain constant over time. DivRank uses a vertex-reinforced random walk model to rank graph nodes based on a diversity based centrality.
                        <context>
                            The basic assumption in DivRank is that the transition probability from a node to other is reinforced by the number of previous visits to the target node (<cite id="43" function="ack" polarity="neu">Mei et al., 2010</cite>)  
                        </context>
                        
                        
                        . Particularly, let's assume pT (u, v) is the transition probability from any node u to node v at time T. Then, PT(di, dj) = (1 - A).p*(dj) + A. where Nt (dj ) is the number of times the walk has visited dj up to time T and Here, p*(dj ) is the prior distribution that determines the preference of visiting vertex dj. We try two variants of this algorithm: DivRank, in which P* (dj) is uniform, and DivRank with priors in which p*(dj) oc 1(Dj)-ß, where l(Dj) is the number of the words in the document Dj and ß is a parameter (ß = 0.8).

                        C-LexRank is a clustering-based model in which the cosine similarities of document pairs are used to build a network of documents. 
                        <context>
                            Then the the network is split into communities, and the most salient documents in each community are selected (<cite id="44" function="ack" polarity="neu">Qazvinian and Radev, 2008</cite>).
                        </context>
                        C-LexRank focuses on finding communities of documents using their cosine similarity. The intuition is that documents that are more similar to each other contain similar factoids. We expect C-LexRank to be a strong ranker, but incapable of capturing the diversity caused by using different phrases to express the same meaning. The reason is that different nuggets that represent the same factoid often have no words in common (e.g., "victory" and "glory") and won't be captured by a lexical measure like cosine similarity.

                    We use each of the systems explained above to rank the summaries in each cluster. Each ranked list is then cut at a certain length (50 words for headlines, and 150 for citations) and the information content in the remaining text is examined using the pyramid score. 
                </paragraph> 
                <paragraph> 
                    Table 3 shows the average pyramid score achieved by different methods in each category. The method based on the distributional similarities of words outperforms other methods in the citations category. All methods show similar results in the headlines category, where most headlines cover at least 1 factoid about the story and a random ranker performs reasonably well. Table 4 shows top 3 headlines from 3 rankers: word distributional similarity (WDS), C-LexRank, and MMR. In this example, the first 3 R=Random; LR=LexRank; DR=DivRank; DR(p)=DivRank with Priors; C-LR=C-LexRank; WDS=Word Distributional Similarity; C.I.=Confidence Interval headlines produced by WDS cover two important factoids: "red sox winning the title" and "fans celebrating". However, the second factoid is absent in the other two. Table 3: Comparison of different ranking systems

            <paragraph> 
                Our experiments on two different categories of human-written summaries (headlines and citations) showed that a lot of the diversity seen in human summarization comes from different nuggets that may actually represent the same semantic information (i.e., factoids). We showed that the factoids exhibit a skewed distribution model, and that the size of the nugget inventory asymptotic behavior even with a large number of summaries. We also showed high variation in summary quality across different summaries in terms of pyramid score, and that the information covered by reading n summaries has a rapidly growing asymptotic behavior as n increases. Finally, we proposed a ranking system that employs word distributional similarities to identify semanti-cally equivalent words, and compared it with a wide range of summarization systems that leverage diversity. 
            </paragraph> 
            <paragraph> 
                In the future, we plan to move to content from other collective systems on Web.In order to generalize our findings, we plan to examine blog comments, online reviews, and tweets (that discuss the same URL). We also plan to build a generation system that employs the Yule model (<cite id="44">Yule, 1925</cite>) to determine the importance of each aspect (e.g. who, when, where, etc.) in order to produce summaries that include diverse aspects of a story. 
            </paragraph> 
            <paragraph> 
                Our work has resulted in a publicly available dataset of 25 annotated news clusters with nearly 1 , 400 headlines, and 25 clusters of citation sentences with more than 900 citations. We believe that this dataset can open new dimensions in studying diversity and other aspects of automatic text generation.
