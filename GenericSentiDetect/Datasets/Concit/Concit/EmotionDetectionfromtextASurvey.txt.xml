                This survey describes recent works in the field of Emotion Detection from text, being a part of the broader area of Affective Computing. This survey has been inspired on the well-known fact that, despite there is a lot of work on emotional detection systems, a lot of work is expected to be done yet. The increment of these systems is due to the large amount of emotional data available in Social Web. Detecting emotions from text have attracted the attention of many researchers in computational linguistics because it has a wide range of applications, such as suicide prevention or measuring well-being of a community. This paper mainly collects works based on lexical and machine learning approaches and these works are classificated in accordance with the emotional model and the approach used.

                For this reason, we decided to develop a survey about emotion detection systems from text and make it available to researcher community. 
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>
                In this survey, we classify the most relevant emotion detection works in accordance with the emotional model and the approach used. A numerical comparison is not possible since each work used different data sets to evaluate their systems. 
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>
                Regarding the search strategy used in the survey, we have looked for all of papers related to emotion detection from text in different research databases like Scopus  or IEEE Xplore . Later on, we have reviewed the papers obtained of these databases and have selected the best papers that use lexical approach or machine learning approach in their emotion detection systems. The selection criterion used is based on the relevance of each work in the field of Affective Computing. 
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>
                This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, describes the emotional models. Section 3, the different computational approaches for emotion detection is described. Finally, in section 4, we express our conclusions about this survey.

                The valence dimension indicates how much PLEASANT and UNPLEASANT is an emotion. The arousal dimension differentiates ACTIVATION and DEACTIVATION states.

                    Although existing emotional categories and emotional dimensions for representing affective states, categorical approaches are the most commonly used <cite id="12" function="ack" polarity="neu">(Calvo 2013)</cite>, 
                </context>
                as we can check out in next section. Most of computational approaches are based on emotional categories, due to its simplicity and familiarity. Nevertheless, emotional categories may not cover all emotions adequately because emotion categories are limited. This is a major benefit of emotional dimensional models. They are not correlated to a certain emotional state and are able to capture subtle emotion concepts that differ only slightly. 
                <context>
                    In addition, a dimensional emotion model provides a means for measuring similarity between affective states <cite id="13" function="ack" polarity="neu">(Kim 2011)</cite>.

                As we can observe, there are not an emotion model better than other. Both models have advantages and disadvantages. The election of an emotion model depends on the set of emotions that we want detect.

                3  Computational approaches for emotion detection 
            </title>
            <paragraph>
                Emotion detection techniques can be divided into lexicon based approaches and machine learning approaches. On the one hand, lexicon based approaches rely on lexical resources such as lexicons, bags of words or ontologies. On the other hand, Machine Learning (ML) approaches apply ML algorithms based on linguistic features.

            <paragraph>
                Lexicon based approaches are approaches that only use one or several lexical resources to detect emotions detection. 
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>
                Among these approaches, we can find keyword-based approaches that are based on predetermining a set of terms to classify the text into emotion categories.

                EmotiNet models situations as chains of actions and their corresponding emotional effect using an ontological representation. Their evaluation consists in testing if by employing the model they build and the knowledge contained in the core of EmotiNet, they are able to detect the emotion expressed in new examples pertaining to the categories in International Survey of Emotional Antecedents and Reactions (ISEAR), through computing the similarity between the emotion chain of the new situation and the EmotiNet emotion chains. 
                
                Their evaluation shows that the structure and content of EmotiNet are appropriate to address the automatic treatment of implicitly expressed affect.

                    Machine learning is a scientific discipline that deals with the construction and study of algorithms that can learn from data <cite id="21" function="ack" polarity="neu">(Kovahi 1998)</cite>.
                </context>
                <context>
                    Such algorithms operate by building a model based on inputs and using these inputs to make predictions or decisions, rather than following only explicitly programmed instructions <cite id="22" function="ack" polarity="neu">(Bishop 2006)</cite>.

                Specifically in emotion detection, Machine learning algorithms are used to learn how detect emotions. These approaches can be divided into supervised and unsupervised learning.
            </paragraph> 
            <paragraph>
                Supervised learning approaches rely on a labelled training data, a set of training examples. 
                <context>
                    The supervised learning algorithm analyses the training data and infers a function, which we use for mapping new examples <cite id="23" function="ack" polarity="neu">(Mohri 2012)</cite>.

                A labelled corpus is a large and structured set of text that it is necessary annotated with emotional tags. In this case, the annotation process is considered as one of their most important disadvantages as it becomes a tedious and time-consuming task. However, there are recent works related with emotion detection in Twitter messages, where the training examples are automatically labelled through hashtags and emoticons contained.

                Concerning works that apply supervised learning algorithms, we can find both the categorical and the dimensional approaches to base their emotional models.

                4  Conclusion 
            </title>
            <paragraph>
                In this survey, we have started discussing the emotion models defined by psychologies because it is the base of emotion detection.
                <context>
                    As concluding by <cite id="42" function="ack" polarity="neu">(Calvo 2013)</cite> and we have check out, categorical approach is the model more used in emotion detection systems. 
                </context>

                    Regarding Lexical approaches, keyword-based approaches are easily implementable and we can obtain good accuracy values, even though this approach has drawbacks: determining the content of the emotion lexicon is subjective, obtaining wrong recall values and the select words may be ambiguous <cite id="43" function="ack" polarity="neu"> (Suttles 2013)</cite>.
                </context>

                Moreover, it is not suitable for wide range of domains. 
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>
                With respect to approaches based on ontologies let us use commonsense knowledge and improve recall values but the creation of an emotional ontology is a tedious and time-consuming task. 
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>
                Consequently, lexical resources usually are used as features in Machine Learning algorithms. 
                <context>
                    As for Machine Learning approaches, the supervised learning approach is more used in emotion detection because it usually leads to better results than unsupervised learning <cite id="44" function="ack" polarity="neu">(Kim 2011)</cite>. 
                </context>
                Although, these approaches need labelling training examples and annotating of examples, which is a time-consuming task. For this reason, several researches have analyzed as  
            
  
   
                Table 1:  Emotion Detection approaches 
 
  
                realize this task automatically and when our system process Twitter messages, the messages can be annotated through hashtags or emotions that it contains. 
            
            </paragraph>

                <context>
                    Although unsupervised learning approach leads worse results than supervised learning, it can be a good election for the emotion detection task because the emotional interpretations of a text can be highly subjective and the annotation task is an error prone task <cite id="45" function="ack" polarity="neu">(Kim 2011)</cite>
                </context>
            </paragraph>
                
            
            <paragraph>
                In conclusion, Machine Learning approaches are better option for detection emotion task since we obtain a model is also able to detect emotions in texts that have only an indirect reference to an emotions. Although, it is important use a good lexical resource as features in Machine Learning algorithms to obtain good results. 
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>
                Concerning pending tasks in emotion detection field, we consider really important that researcher community establish an annotated corpus and a set of metrics that it may be used to evaluate the different existing systems and the future systems. Moreover, in emotional detection systems based on machine learning approach, we have detected that most of these systems use features based on a shallow analysis on the text as: n-grams, punctuation, emoticons or   
                Part-Of-Speech. Hence, we propose a new direction focuses on deep analysis, since we consider that if we use features based on a deep analyis on the text we could improve the emotional detection systems.  
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>
                based on a deep analysis on the text we could improve the emotional detection systems.
