            <paragraph> 
                In this paper we investigate how to automatically determine if two document collections are written from different perspectives. 
                By perspectives we mean a point of view, for example, from the perspective of Democrats or Republicans. 
                We propose a test of different perspectives based on distribution divergence between the statistical models of two collections. 
                Experimental results show that the test can successfully distinguish document collections of different perspectives from other types of collections.

            <title>1 Introduction</title> 
            <paragraph> 
                Conflicts arise when two groups of people take very different perspectives on political, socio-economical, or cultural issues. 
                For example, here are the answers that two presidential candidates, John Kerry and George Bush, gave during the third presidential debate in 2004 in response to a question on abortion: 
            </paragraph> 
            <paragraph> 
                (1) Kerry: What is an article of faith for me is not something that I can legislate on somebody who doesn't share that article of faith. 
                I believe that choice is a woman's choice. 
                It's between a woman, God and her doctor. 
                And that's why I support that. 
                (2) Bush: I believe the ideal world is one in which every child is protected in law and welcomed to life. 
            </paragraph> 
            <paragraph> 
                I understand there's great differences on this issue of abortion, but I believe reasonable people can come together and put good law in place that will help reduce the number of abortions. 
                After reading the above transcripts some readers may conclude that one takes a "pro-choice" perspective while the other takes a "pro-life" perspective, the two dominant perspectives in the abortion controversy. 
            </paragraph> 
            <paragraph> 
                Perspectives, however, are not always manifested when two pieces of text together are put together. 
                For example, the following two sentences are from Reuters newswire: 
            </paragraph> 
            <paragraph> 
                (3) Gold output in the northeast China province of Heilongjiang rose 22.7 pct in 1986 from 1985's level, the New China News Agency said. 
                (4) Exco Chairman Richard Lacy told Reuters the acquisition was being made from Bank of New York Co Inc, which currently holds a 50.1 pct, and from RMJ partners who hold the remainder. 
            </paragraph> 
            <paragraph> 
                A reader would not from this pair of examples perceive as strongly contrasting perspectives as the Kerry-Bush answers. 
                Instead, as the Reuters an-notators did, one would label Example 3 as "gold" and Example 4 as "acquisition", that is, as two topics instead of two perspectives. 
            </paragraph> 
            <paragraph> 
                Why does the contrast between Example 1 and Example 2 convey different perspectives, but the contrast between Example 3 and Example 4 result in different topics? 
                How can we define the impalpable "different perspectives" anyway? 
                The definition of "perspective" in the dictionary is "subjective evaluation of relative significance," but can we have a computable definition to test the existence of different perspectives?

            </paragraph> 
            <paragraph> 
                The research question about the definition of different perspectives is not only scientifically intriguing, it also enables us to develop important natural language processing applications. 
                Such a computational definition can be used to detect the emergence of contrasting perspectives. 
                Media and political analysts regularly monitor broadcast news, magazines, newspapers, and blogs to see if there are public opinion splitting. 
                The huge number of documents, however, make the task extremely daunting. 
                Therefore an automated test of different perspectives will be very valuable to information analysts. 
            </paragraph> 
            <paragraph> 
                We first review the relevant work in Section 2. 
                We take a model-based approach to develop a computational definition of different perspectives. 
                We first develop statistical models for the two document collections, A and B, and then measure the degree of contrast by calculating the "distance" between A and B. How document collections are statistically modeled and how distribution difference is estimated are described in Section 3. 
                The document corpora are described in Section 4. 
                In Section 5, we evaluate how effective the proposed test of difference perspectives based on statistical distribution. 
                The experimental results show that the distribution divergence can successfully separate document collections of different perspectives from other kinds of collection pairs. 
                We also investigate if the pattern of distribution difference is due to personal writing or speaking styles.

                Although we expect by its very nature much of the language used when expressing a perspective to be subjective and opinionated, the task of labeling a document or a sentence as subjective is orthogonal to the test of different perspectives. 
                A subjectivity classifier may successfully identify all subjective sentences in the document collection pair A and B, but knowing the number of subjective sentences in A and B does not necessarily tell us if they convey opposing perspectives. 
                <context><author>We</author>

                The high but almost equivalent number of subjective sentences in two perspectives suggests that perspective is largely expressed in subjective language but subjectivity ratio is not enough to tell if two document collections are written from the same (Palestinian v.s. Palestinian) or different perspectives (Palestinian v.s. Israeli).

            <paragraph> 
                We take a model-based approach to measure to what degree, if any, two document collections are different. 
                A document is represented as a point in a V-dimensional space, where V is vocabulary size. 
                Each coordinate is the frequency of a word in a document, i.e., term frequency. 
                Although vector representation, commonly known as a bag of words, is oversimplified and ignores rich syntactic and semantic structures, more sophisticated representation requires more data to obtain reliable models.

                <kw>However</kw>, the close subjectivity ratio
                doesn't mean that subjectivity <negfeature>can never help</negfeature>

                For example, the accuracy of the test of different perspectives may be improved by focusing on only subjective sentences.

                We assume that a collection of N documents, Vi, V2, ■ ■ ■ ,Vn are sampled from the following process,

            <paragraph> 
                We first sample a V-dimensional vector 6 from a Dirichlet prior distribution with a hyperparameter a, and then sample a document yi repeatedly from a Multinomial distribution conditioned on the parameter 6, where ni is the document length of the ith document in the collection and assumed to be known and fixed.

            <paragraph> 
                To evaluate how well KL divergence between posterior distributions can discern a document collection pair of different perspectives, we collect two corpora of documents that were written or spoken from different perspectives and one newswire corpus that covers various topics, as summarized in Table 1. 
                No stemming algorithms is performed; no stopwords are removed.

            <paragraph> 
                The first perspective corpus consists of articles published on the bitterlemons website from late 2001 to early 2005. 
                The website is set up to "contribute to mutual understanding [between Palestinians and Israelis] through the open exchange of ideas". 
                Every week an issue about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is selected for discussion (e.g., "Disengagement: unilateral or coordinated?"), and a Palestinian editor and an Israeli editor each contribute one article addressing the issue. 
                In addition, the Israeli and Palestinian editors interview a guest to express their views on the issue, resulting in a total of four articles in a weekly edition. 
                The perspective from which each article is written is labeled as either Palestinian or Israeli by the editors.

            <paragraph> 
                The second perspective corpus consists of the transcripts of the three Bush-Kerry presidential debates in 2004. 
                The transcripts are from the website of the Commission on Presidential Debates. 
                Each spoken document is roughly an answer to a question or a rebuttal. 
                The transcript are segmented by the speaker tags already in the transcripts. 
                All words from moderators are discarded.

            <paragraph> 
                The topical corpus contains newswire from Reuters in 1987. 
                Reuters-21578 is one of the most common testbeds for text categorization. 
                Each document belongs to none, one, or more of the 135 categories (e.g., "Mergers" and "U.S. Dollars".) 
                The number of documents in each category is not evenly distributed (median 9.0, mean 105.9). 
                To estimate statistics reliably, we only consider categories with more than 500 documents, resulting in a total of seven categories (ACQ, CRUDE, EARN, GRAIN, INTEREST, MONEY-FX, and 
                TRADE).

                A test of different perspectives is acute when it can draw distinctions between document collection pairs of different perspectives and document collection pairs ofthe same perspective and others. 
                We thus evaluate the proposed test of different perspectives in the following four types of document collection pairs (A, B): 
            </paragraph> 
            <paragraph> 
                Different Perspectives (DP) A and B are written from different perspectives. 
                For example, A is written from the Palestinian perspective and B is written from the Israeli perspective in the bitterlemons corpus. 
            </paragraph> 
            <paragraph> 
                Same Perspective (SP) A and B are written from the same perspective. 
                For example, A and B consist of the words spoken by Kerry. 
            </paragraph> 
            <paragraph> 
                Different Topics (DT) A and B are written on different topics. 
                For example, A is about acquisition (ACQ) and B is about crude oil (CRUDE). 
                http://www.debates.org/pages/ debtrans.html 
                http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kdd/ databases/reuters21578/reuters21578.html 
            </paragraph> 
            <paragraph> 
                Same Topic (ST) A and B are written on the same topic. 
                For example, A and B are both about earnings (EARN). 
            </paragraph> 
            <paragraph> 
                The effectiveness of the proposed test of different perspectives can thus be measured by how the distribution divergence of DP document collection pairs is separated from the distribution divergence of SP, DT, and ST document collection pairs. 
                The little the overlap of the range of distribution divergence, the sharper the test of different perspectives. 
            </paragraph> 
            <paragraph> 
                To account for large variation in the number of words and vocabulary size across corpora, we normalize the total number of words in a document collection to be the same K, and consider only the top C% frequent words in the document collection pair. 
                We vary the values of K and C, and find that K changes the absolute scale of KL divergence but does not change the rankings of four conditions. 
                Rankings among four conditions is consistent when C is small. 
                We only report results of K = 1000, C = 10 in the paper due to space limit. 
                There are two kinds of variances in the estimation of divergence between two posterior distribution and should be carefully checked. 
                The first kind of variance is due to Monte Carlo methods. 
                We assess the Monte Carlo variance by calculating a 100a percent confidence interval as follows, where â is the sample variance of 01,02,..., Qu, and $(•)_1 is the inverse of the standard normal cumulative density function. 
                The second kind of variance is due to the intrinsic uncertainties ofdata generating processes. 
                We assess the second kind of variance by collecting 1000 bootstrapped samples, that is, sampling with replacement, from each document collection pair.

                <subtitle>5.1 Quality of Monte Carlo Estimates</subtitle> 
                <paragraph> 
                    The Monte Carlo estimates of the KL divergence from several document collection pair are listed in Table 2. 
                    A complete list of the results is omitted due to the space limit. 
                    We can see that the 95% confidence interval captures well the Monte Carlo estimates of KL divergence.

                <subtitle>5.2 Test of Different Perspectives</subtitle> 
                <paragraph> 
                    We now present the main result of the paper. 
                    We calculate the KL divergence between posterior distributions of document collection pairs in four conditions using Monte Carlo methods, and plot the results in Figure 1. 
                    The test of different perspectives based on statistical distribution divergence is shown to be very acute. 
                    The KL divergence of the document collection pairs in the DP condition fall mostly in the middle range, and is well separated from the high KL divergence of the pairs in DT condition and from the low KL divergence of the pairs in SP and ST conditions. 
                    Therefore, by simply calculating the KL divergence of a document collection pair, we can reliably predict that they are written from different perspectives if the value of KL divergence falls in the middle range, from different topics if the value is very large, from the same topic or perspective if the value is very small.

                <subtitle>5.3 Personal Writing Styles or Perspectives?</subtitle> 
                <paragraph> 
                    One may suspect that the mid-range distribution divergence is attributed to personal speaking or writing styles and has nothing to do with different perspectives. 
                    The doubt is expected because half of the bitterlemons corpus are written by one Palestinian editor and one Israeli editor (see Table 1), and the debate transcripts come from only two candidates. 
                </paragraph> 
                <paragraph> 
                    We test the hypothesis by computing the distribution divergence of the document collection pair (Israeli Guest, Palestinian Guest), that is, a Different Perspectives (DP) pair. 
                    There are more than 200 different authors in the Israeli Guest and Palestinian Guest collection. 
                    If the distribution divergence of the pair with diverse authors falls out of the middle range, it will support that mid-range divergence is due to writing styles. 
                    On the other hand, if the distribution divergence still fall in the middle range, we are more conident the effect is attributed to different perspectives. 
                    We compare the distribution divergence of the pair (Israeli Guest, Palestinian Guest) with others in Figure 2. 
                    Figure 2: The average KL divergence of document collection pairs in the bitterlemons Guest subset (Israeli Guest vs. Palestinian Guest), ST ,SP, DP, DT conditions. 
                    The horizontal lines are the same as those in Figure 1. 
                </paragraph> 
                <paragraph> 
                    The results show that the distribution divergence ofthe (Israeli Guest, Palestinian Guest) pair, as other pairs in the DP condition, still falls in the middle range, and is well separated from SP and ST in the low range and DT in the high range. 
                    The decrease in KL divergence due to writing or speaking styles is noticeable, and the overall effect due to different perspectives is strong enough to make the test robust. 
                    We thus conclude that the test of different perspectives based on distribution divergence indeed captures different perspectives, not personal writing or speaking styles.

                    KL Divergence 
                    Figure 1: The KL divergence of the document collection pairs in four conditions: Different Perspectives (DP), Same Perspective (SP), Different Topics (DT), and Same Topic (ST). 
                    Note that the x axis is in log scale. 
                    The Monte Carlo estimates D of the pairs in DP condition are plotted as rugs. 
                    D of the pairs in other conditions are omitted to avoid clutter and summarized in one-dimensional density using Kernel Density Estimation. 
                    The vertical lines are drawn at the points with equivalent densities. 
                    wonder why the distribution divergence of the document collection pair with different perspectives falls in the middle range and what causes the large and small divergence of the document collection pairs with different topics (DT) and the same topic (ST) or perspective (SP), respectively. 
                    In other words where do the differences result from? 
                </paragraph> 
                <paragraph> 
                    We answer the question by taking a closer look at the causes of the distribution divergence in our model. 
                    We compare the expected marginal difference of 6 between two posterior distributions p(6\A) and p(6\!B). 
                    The marginal distribution of the i-th coordinate of 6, that is, the i-th word in the vocabulary, is a Beta distribution, and thus the expected value can be easily calculated. 
                    We plot the A6 = E[6i\ A] - E[6i\B] against E[6i\A] for each condition in Figure 3. 
                </paragraph> 
                <paragraph> 
                    How A6 is deviated from zero partially explains different patterns of distribution divergence in Figure 1. 
                    In Figure 3d we see that the A6 increases as 6 increases, and the deviance from zero is much greater than those in the Same Perspective (Figure 3b) and Same Topic (Figure 3a) conditions. 
                    The large A6 not only accounts for large distribution divergence of the document pairs in DT conditions, but also shows that words in different topics that is frequent in one topic are less likely to be frequent in the other topic. 
                    At the other extreme, document collection pairs of the Same Perspective (SP) or Same Topic (ST) show very little difference in 6, which matches our intuition that documents of the same perspective or the same topic use the same vocabulary in a very similar way. 
                </paragraph> 
                <paragraph> 
                    The manner in which A6 is varied with the value of 6 in the Different Perspective (DP) condition is very unique. 
                    The A6 in Figure 3c is not as small as those in the SP and ST conditions, but at the same time not as large as those in DT conditions, resulting in mid-range distribution divergence in Figure 1. 
                    Why do document collections of different perspectives distribute this way? 
                    Partly because articles from different perspectives focus on the closely related issues (the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in the bitterlemons corpus, or the political and economical issues in the debate corpus), the authors of different perspectives write or speak in a similar vocabulary, but with emphasis on different words.

                In this paper we develop a computational test of different perspectives based on statistical distribution divergence between the statistical models of document collections.

                posed test can successfully separate document collections of different perspectives from other types of document collection pairs. 
                The distribution divergence falling in the middle range can not simply be attributed to personal writing or speaking styles. 
                From the plot of multinomial parameter difference we offer insights into where the different patterns of distribution divergence come from.

            <paragraph> 
                Although we validate the test of different perspectives by comparing the DP condition with DT, SP, and ST conditions, the comparisons are by no means exhaustive, and the distribution divergence of some document collection pairs may also fall in the middle range.
